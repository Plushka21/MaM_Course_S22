/COM,ANSYS RELEASE 2022 R1           BUILD 22.1      UP20211129       11:47:55

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.484   TIME= 11:47:56
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.484   TIME= 11:47:56
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.484   TIME= 11:47:56
 Material number 11 (used by element 2049) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.484   TIME= 11:47:56
 No constraints have been defined using the D command.                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.547   TIME= 11:47:56
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.547   TIME= 11:47:56
 Certain contact elements (for example 2458 & 2427) overlap with other.  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.031   TIME= 11:47:56
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
